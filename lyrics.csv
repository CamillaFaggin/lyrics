coldplay,birds,"Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
Dreaming of escaping
Will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up
Got me in the rays

So I guess I better stay



Uh uh

No comment! you say

It's a fools gold thunder

It's just a warring rain

Don't let the fears just start ""What if

I wanna see you again?""

Around here you never want to

Sleep all night

So start falling in love

Start the riot, and come on rage with me



We don't need words

We'll be birds 

Got to make our own key



Only got this moment

You and me

Guilty of nothing

But geography



Come on, and raise it

Come on raise this noise

For the million people

Who got not one voice

Come on, it's not over!

If you mean it, say it loud

Come on, all for love

Out from the underground, away with me

We don't need words



Close your eyes and see

We'll be birds

Flying free

Holding on in the mystery



Fearless, fearless, fearless

You said we'll go

Through this together oh

So when you fly, won't you

Won't you take me too?

In this world so cruel

I think you're so cool"
